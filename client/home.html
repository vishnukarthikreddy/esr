          <p> The available leave balance is to be checked by the employee with the HR department and the
            leave to be applied by duly filling up the leave application form and writing in a paper/ through the
            mail/ through online portal. The application has to be forwarded by the employee to their
            departmental head for approval. The departmental head is authorized to either grant or disapprove
            the leave on valid grounds. The approved leave application has to be submitted to the HR
            department for recordings and subsequent processing.<p>
          <h4> CANCELLATION OF LEAVE</h4>
          <p> The department head can also cancel the once sanctioned leave on situational / need basis. If an
            employee proceeds to avail the cancelled leave then those days will be treated as absence from
            duty and the rules pertaining to absence from duty will be applied.</p>
          <h4> ABSENCE FROM DUTY</h4>
          <p> When an employee takes off from duty without prior leave approval or proper intimation
            under certain unavoidable circumstances, then those day/days will be treated as absence
            from duty.<p>
          <p>The days of absence will be treated under Loss of Pay.<p>
          <p>The employee has to report to his / her department head on rejoining duty from absence
            and provide valid reasons for absence in writing before taking up work again.<p>
          <p> If an employee is absent from duty continuously for more than 7 days (including any
            National / Festival / Declared / weekly off days which may fall in-between), an official
            correspondence from the HR department will be<p>
          sent to him asking to report to duty and to provide explanation for his/her absence.<p>
          <p>Based on the enquiry any action deemed fit will/would be taken by the management.<p>
          <p> If there were no response from the employee within the stipulated time mentioned in
            official correspondence, it would be assumed that the employee has withdrawn his service
            from the company on his/her own accord and recorded accordingly.<p>
